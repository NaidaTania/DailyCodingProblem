A unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value.

Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees

Approach: binary tree recursion (start from the leaves)
count the left's total unival, and whether that leaf is a unival or not
count the right's total unival, and whether that leaf is a unival or not
if both are unival, check if the root value is the same as the leaves
